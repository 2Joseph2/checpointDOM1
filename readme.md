# Porsche Shopping Cart

This project is a Porsche-themed shopping cart where users can interact with preselected items. The user can adjust quantities, delete items, like items, and see the total price updated in real-time using DOM manipulation.

## Features

1. **Adjust Quantity**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each item using “+” and “-” buttons.
2. **Delete Items**: Users can remove items from the cart.
3. **Like Items**: Users can like items through a clickable heart-shaped button that changes color when clicked.
4. **Update Total Price**: The total price adjusts dynamically based on the item quantities and deletions.

## Instructions
